# pairedCoding1
This is the first paired programming assignment we worked on.
The aim of this program is to create a rectangle. Once it touches the edge of the canvas,
it will change into a circle, bounce off the edge and change color.
When the circle touched the edge of the canvas, it will turn back into a rectangle.
